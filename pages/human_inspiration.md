Here's a selection of things that inspire me categorized by broad topics.

Note: 
I don't read too many books, mainly because my attention span is quite short when reading.
Over time I've still accumulated a few favorites.
You can check out everything I'm reading at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/karllorey).
