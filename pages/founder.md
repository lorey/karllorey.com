My passion is continuous progress and self-improvement. Probably that explains my love for startups, projects, and competitions.
Below is a selection of startups and projects I have done so far.
If you'd like to see a more comprehensive overview,
take a look at [my CV](https://github.com/lorey/resume) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karllorey).

## Startups
Startups (or startup-like projects):
- [First Momentum Ventures](http://firstmomentum.vc)
  I've co-founded my own Venture Capital fund and firm, currently leading the investment and tech team. We're the first fund founded by students in Germany and probably the youngest fund all over Europe.
- [German IT Jobs](http://germanitjobs.com)
  Before First Momentum, I co-founded an HR startup. We built a platform that helped foreign developers to find a job in Germany while focusing on an automated screening process.
- [Kursverwaltung Online (German SaaS for online course enrollment)](http://kursverwaltungonline.de)
  This was my very first project I started during school. I built a (German) SaaS solution for schools to enroll students into courses. The software is still in use.
- [Road Genius](http://roadgenius.de)
  Together with a team of three I built an app for children to play when traveling and won EUs largest automotive hackathon.

## Projects/Portfolio
These are my latest projects in chronological order from new/updated to old/offline:

- [socials](https://github.com/lorey/socials) and [social media regular expressions](https://github.com/lorey/social-media-profiles-regexs) -
  Since I'm doing a lot of social network analysis, esp. for university and First Momentum, I've always been interested to extract social profiles.
  I thus created a [collection of regular expressions to match social media profiles](https://github.com/lorey/social-media-profiles-regexs).
  Building upon this collection, I've created a Python library called [socials](https://github.com/lorey/socials) that extracts social profiles from websites/html (e.g. those in my footer).
- [Programmer Personality](https://programmerpersonality.com) -
  To understand the relationships between personality and the online behavior of programmers, I built this web app for my master thesis.
  For GDPR reasons, I've taken it offline, but you could basically log in, perform a personality test, and compare your results with your peer group and other programmers.
  In a very limited timespan, I was able to generate significant traction, got over 1000 users, and could thus get enough training data for my research to yield groundbreaking results.
- [ProgrammerMap](http://programmermap.com) -
  Since my bachelor's thesis, I was very interested in influence in online social networks.
  To apply my theoretical knowledge, I scraped GitHub and computed influencers which yielded the most influential programmers worldwide.
  As an additional benefit, I listed the most influential programmers in around 50 cities worldwide.
  Since I'm not running the crawler anymore and GDPR compliance would take some time to implement, I had to take the site offline.
- [Startup Karlsruhe](http://startup-karlsruhe.de) -
  As a small side project during my time as President of [Germany's biggest student entrepreneurship club, PionierGarage,](https://pioniergarage.de)
  I built a small German site that provides an overview of the startup ecosystem in Karlsruhe.
- [Button 1](http://button1.de) -
  For a startup competiton, 3 Day Startup at WHU, we developed a one click button solution like Amazon Dash but for B2B2C.
  During the two days of competiton, I developed a fully-working SaaS backend.
