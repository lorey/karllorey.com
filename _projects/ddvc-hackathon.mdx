Built at the Data-Driven VC Hackathon organized by Red River West & Bivwak! by BNP Paribas in Paris.

We believe agentic behavior will take Venture Capital into the AI era. To support VCs in their day-to-day work, we created an agentic framework that provides the basis for agentic behavior in daily operations.

Features:

- Automated monitoring of portfolio companies (or targets) in any funnel
- Fully integrated into the CRM
- Automatic monitoring of the ecosystem
- Agentic creation of signals/alerts with proposed course of action

Sources for signals include headcount monitoring via Harmonic, open positions via PredictLeads, reporting analysis via OpenAI, competitor monitoring via SimilarWeb, and tracking of mentions around the web.
