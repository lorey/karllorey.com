For my Bachelor's thesis, I developed a concept very similar to that of Cambridge Analytica.
During that time, it became clear that Facebook's Open Graph API yielded much more information about users than intended or ethically responsible.
To prove this, I developed a quiz app that extracts Facebook user data.
With a single user of the quiz, we could derive how much all of their friends influence them.

Our goal was to derive influence based on users' online behavior in the same way that Cambridge Analytica later derived personality based on online behavior.
My work resulted in two publications:

- _Assessment of subjective influence and trust with an online social network game._ Computers in Human Behavior, Volume 64, November 2016.
- _Gamification framework for personalized surveys on relationships in online social networks._ 2013 IEEE/ACM 6th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing
