Evalry helps developers find the optimal language model for their specific use case by running custom benchmarks against 300+ models at once.

Instead of relying on generic benchmarks like MMLU, you can test your actual prompts and compare quality, speed, and cost side-by-side. Many users discover models that cost 90% less while performing equivalently on their task.
