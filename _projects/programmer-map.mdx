Since my bachelor's thesis, I was very interested in influence in online social networks.
To apply my theoretical knowledge, I scraped GitHub and computed influencers which yielded the most influential programmers worldwide.
To display the results, I created [ProgrammerMap](http://programmermap.com), where I listed the most influential programmers in around 50 cities worldwide.

_Note: Taken offline as the crawler is no longer running and GDPR compliance would require significant implementation effort._
