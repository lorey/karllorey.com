[Programmer Personality](https://programmerpersonality.com) was a web app I built for my master thesis to understand the relationships between personality and the online behavior of programmers.
Users could log in, perform a personality test, and compare their results with their peer group and other programmers.

In a very limited timespan, I generated significant traction with over 1000 users, providing enough training data for my research.
For the first time, I was able to prove a relationship between personality and programmer behavior.
I could prove that personality influences the choice of programming language, technology stack, as well as behavior on GitHub.
