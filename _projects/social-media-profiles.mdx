Since I'm doing a lot of social network analysis, especially for university and First Momentum, I've always been interested in extracting social profiles.
I created a [collection of regular expressions to match social media profiles](https://github.com/lorey/social-media-profiles-regexs).
Building upon this collection, I've created a Python library called [socials](https://github.com/lorey/socials) that extracts social profiles from websites/html.
