Before First Momentum and during my master studies, I co-founded an HR startup called [German IT Jobs](http://germanitjobs.com).
We built a platform that helped foreign developers find a job in Germany while focusing on an automated sourcing and screening process.
As a co-founder, I was responsible for developing the business together with my co-founder and leading the technological development as CTO.

Key achievements:

- Developed an algorithm to find developers globally matching specific job ads
- Designed and implemented a platform with conversion rates significantly higher than industry average
- Automated the active sourcing process, reducing recruiter time by 90%
- Leveraged Facebook's ad engine to target IT professionals worldwide at cost per application far below industry average
