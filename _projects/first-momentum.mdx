With [First Momentum Ventures](http://firstmomentum.vc), we built Germany's first venture capital fund founded while still being students, and probably the youngest fund all over Europe.
As a co-founder, I was one of two chief executives, responsible for strategy, products, and technology.
My technical and academic background allowed me to build automated and scalable approaches to investing and Venture Capital in general.

Key achievements:

- Set up and executed a Venture Capital fund, raising 5 million Euros from investors
- Designed and implemented a crawler network spotting every early-stage startup in the DACH region
- Built and launched a platform enabling investors to access our dealflow
- Created a machine learning solution to predict relevant dealflow, saving 50%+ screening time
- Led investments in and advised [Peers](https://www.peers-solutions.com/) and [Verlingo](https://www.verlingo.de/)
