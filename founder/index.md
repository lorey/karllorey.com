I believe in a world where data-driven decisions form the basis of business strategies.
In my career so far,
I've solved business problems with advanced technological approaches,
in particular with the help of data aggregation and machine learning.
Besides that, my passion is continuous progress and self-improvement. 

Below is an overview of my work experience so far.

# Managing Partner, First Momentum

# CTO, German IT Jobs
Before First Momentum and during my master studies, I co-founded an HR startup called [German IT Jobs](http://germanitjobs.com).
We built a platform that helped foreign developers to find a job in Germany while focusing on an automated sourcing and screening process.
As a co-founder, I was responsible for developing the business together with my co-founder and leading the technological development as the CTO.

- developed an algorithm to find developers globally matching a specific job ad
- designed and implemented a platform that allowed foreign developers to apply for jobs resulting in conversion rates significantly higher than the industry average
- automated the active sourcing process of recruiters resulting in a 90% reduction of time required to find applicants
- leveraged Facebook's ad engine to target IT professionals woldwide resulting in a cost per application far below industry average

# Co-Founder, Road Genius
Together with a team of three I built an app for children to play when traveling and won EUs largest automotive hackathon.
With our idea, [Road Genius](http://roadgenius.de), we pitched in front of Volkswagen's C-level executives and were in talks to sell our app to Volkswagen.
