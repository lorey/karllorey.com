I believe in a world where data-driven decisions form the basis of business strategies.
Throughout my career, I've solved business problems with advanced technological approaches, particularly through data aggregation and machine learning.

## Apistemic

Currently, I'm building [Apistemic](https://apistemic.com), a company focused on providing data and intelligence for the startup ecosystem.
Our products include [Apistemic Markets](https://markets.apistemic.com) for market intelligence and [Apistemic Logos](https://logos.apistemic.com) for brand assets.

Before Apistemic, I co-founded [First Momentum Ventures](https://firstmomentum.vc), Germany's first student-founded VC fund, and built [StartupRadar](https://startupradar.co) for startup discovery.

## Background

I've been building companies and products since my school days, from SaaS platforms to HR tech to venture capital infrastructure.
