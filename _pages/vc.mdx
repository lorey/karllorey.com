I've been active in venture capital since 2018, first as a fund co-founder and now building tools for the ecosystem.

## First Momentum Ventures

In 2018, I co-founded [First Momentum Ventures](https://firstmomentum.vc), Germany's first venture capital fund founded by students.
We raised 5 million Euros and invested in young, ambitious, and technical startups through pre-seed investments.
As one of two managing partners, I was responsible for strategy, products, and technology.

During my time at First Momentum, I built automated systems for startup discovery that gave us a competitive edge in finding deals early.
This technology later became the foundation for [StartupRadar](https://startupradar.io).

## StartupRadar

Building on the dealflow technology from First Momentum, I created [StartupRadar](https://startupradar.io) as a platform for discovering and analyzing early-stage startups.
It helps investors, accelerators, and ecosystem builders find promising companies before anyone else.

## Investment Interests

I'm especially interested in:

- **Machine Learning and AI**: Competitive advantages through technology
- **Developer Tools**: Products that make programmers more productive
- **HR and New Work**: Building on my experience as CTO of an HR startup
