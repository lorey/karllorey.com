title: Pre-seed Investments in Germany
---
body:

As a co-founder of Germany's first student-run Venture Capital fund, [First Momentum Ventures](http://firstmomentum.vc),
I invest in young startups (mostly pre-seed). We're primarily focused on student founders, B2B, and tech startups.
Personally, I'm especially interested in the following areas:
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
- New Work and Human Resources
- Programming tools and aids
- B2B SaaS
