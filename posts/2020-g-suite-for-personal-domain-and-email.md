Using Google's [G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/) for your personal domain allows you to use your domain with all of Google's tools.
It includes Gmail (without ads), Meet, Calendar, Drive with > 30 GB, Docs, etc.
What differentiates it from a regular Google account is that you can use your personal domain and thus your own email, e.g. mail@yourname.com.
After having used a G Suite of my company for a while, I wanted to have it for my personal email and domain, too.

# Benefits
Besides being able to use your personal email for everything and as a Google account, you get:

- event/calendar invites sent to your email will be added to your calendar automatically
- people can invite you to events/docs/drive with your private email
- your Android phone has all the Google tools built in and provides a seamless experience
- and so on, I mean, everybody has a Google account nowadays

# Costs/Pricing
If you G-Suite use it for your personal domain, you'll be needing one user only.
So the price is between 6 and 25 USD per month.
You'll be needing the basic version for 6 USD only, I think.

# Getting started
So I basically signed up for a free trial.
Google asked me for my main email, i.e. the one used for your Google account.
I choose mail@mydomain.com (say hello if you like :) ).

There are only a few steps to take and the experience is seamless:

- create a G Suite account
- set up your [MX records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) to point at Google's mailservers
  (Google provided a tutorial for my registrar automatically)
- wait a little, and you're ready to go
- notify contacts of your (new) email

# Set up
Personally, I didn't change much, but here's what I found useful:

- Gmail: set up a signature, change GMail's layout
- Calendar: set up default notifications for events 30 and 3 minutes ahead 
  (allows me to get notified early during deep work and just before calls)
- Drive: Migrate folders/files to your new personal Google Drive. 
  You can do this by sharing files and folders from your old account to your new account.

# Misc
Some random notes:

- somehow you automatically become a business customer and can't change that, which is weird but isn't a problem in my case
- site verification, a part of the setup process, took a long time. Just give it a few minutes for the DNS records to update.
