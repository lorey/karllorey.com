I've also found my template to be quite messy and without clean syntax.\n- There's a plugin system heavily relying on [doit](https://pydoit.org/) which makes site-creation very efficient but extending as a result rather difficult to understand. For example, I don't know how to insert a list of all subpages into the the current page which should be quite easy.\n\n# Issues\n\nIf you're also getting started, here are the issues I ran into.\nAs I said, not many and not frustrating :)\n\n## Overwriting themes\n\nWhile there are a few basic and advanced themes you can build upon,\nit took me quite some time to find out where these themes can be found.\nThis is necessary to understand which files there are and which files you need to overwrite to adapt a theme.\nBasically most templates you can inherit from can be found at [nikola-themes](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola-themes)\nbut some basic templates are stored within [Nikola itself](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/tree/c886ea38f7ee34f1fffb3edae7087694483a999d/nikola/data/themes).\nIf you've understood this, you basically just copy/paste the files you want to adapt inside your own theme\nwhich works really nice.\n\n## Deployment with existing gh-pages\n\nSince I had previously set up Lektor deployment via GitHub Pages, I already had a `gh-pages` branch.\nSo when I tried to deploy via `nikola github_deploy`, I got the following error:\n\n```text\nTo github.com:lorey/karllorey.com.git\n ! [rejected]        gh-pages -> gh-pages (fetch first)\nerror: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:lorey/karllorey.com.git'\nhint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do\nhint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing\nhint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes\nhint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.\nhint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.\n# .stacktrace\n[2020-02-25T15:12:28Z] ERROR: github_deploy: Failed GitHub deployment -- command ['ghp-import', '-n', '-m', 'Nikola auto commit.\\n\\nSource commit: 5d74f162affaf80691de1d7c7b0d8728addea96a\\nNikola version: 8.0.4', '-p', '-r', 'origin', '-b', 'gh-pages', 'output'] returned 1\n```\n\nObviously, I forgot to pull the gh-pages branch first, so the new commit could be added on top.\nAfter doing a `git pull origin gh-pages`, deploying worked like a charm.\n\n## Deployment with Travis CI\n\nTo deploy with Travis CI, there's a great [post on the Nikola blog](https://getnikola.com/blog/automating-nikola-rebuilds-with-travis-ci.html).\nWhat I did not understand at first was the distinction between the `master` and a `src` branch.\nSo the `src` branch is used for user pages that are deployed into the master branch, i.e. when you have a site pointing to you username, e.g. `lorey.github.io`.\nIf you do that, you have to use another branch to deploy to avoid an infinite loop (push to master > deploy to master > ...).\nSince I use `gh-pages` as the branch containing all the generated HTML, I set up .travis.yml to deploy on pushes to master.\nIn the `conf.py` I still set:\n\n```python\nGITHUB_SOURCE_BRANCH = 'src'\n```\n\nSeems to work fine.\n\nAnother thing I encountered when setting up Travis CI:\nSomehow the travis gem had issues when logging in so `travis login` and `travis enable` did not work.\nMaybe because I use an old version or have 2FA enabled.\nIn the end I just ran `travis encrypt-file id_rsa --add` which worked fine and added a line to .travis.yml\nstoring the encrypted key.\n\nDoing a `git branch master FETCH_HEAD` inside the .travis.yml failed:\n\n```text\n$ git branch master FETCH_HEAD\nfatal: A branch named 'master' already exists.\nThe command \"git branch master FETCH_HEAD\" failed and exited with 128 during .\n```\n"},"mdxSource":{"compiledSource":"\"use strict\";\nconst {Fragment:
