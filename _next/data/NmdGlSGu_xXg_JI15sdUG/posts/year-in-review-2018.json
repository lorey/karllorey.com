A huge milestone.</li>\n<li>So it was all about fundraising as quick as possible afterwards. Making call, having meetings, presenting at events.</li>\n<li>In June, we were able to to our First Closing. For funds, this is the kick-off and enabled us to actually invest for the first time.</li>\n<li>Quickly afterwards, we announced our first investment in August.</li>\n<li>After the first closing, I switched from fundraising over to investing and started to lead the investing team.</li>\n<li>We managed to grow our investment funnel radically until the end of the year and will announce several investments soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My Challanges</h2>\n<p>To start the actual review of 2018, I will begin with my main challenges this year.</p>\n<h3>Callenge 1: less tech, more management</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, the thing that was really hard this year was the switch from tech to management.\nSince I've mostly had CTO or programmer roles before, I always dealt with a lot of tech.\nThis year, when building the fund I mostly did fundraising, consisting of calls and meetings.\nLater on, when looking for our first investments, I had to build a team, manage it, and still do meetings and calls.\nWhile I like that very much, too, my passion is to build technology.\nAnd most importantly, coding just feels like my personal ikigai.\nIt doesn't bother me to be coding and thus working 16 hours a day.\nI don't get tired, I don't get bored, and I feel extremely satisfied in the evening.\nEven after 16 hours of coding, I have to push myself to stop and go sleeping to be able to retain my run the next day.\nWith other work, especially management, it just does not feel the same.\nYou don't single-task one thing, you're multitasking >10 things a day.\nA while I was able to maintain a solid workload without much coding this year,\nI just miss the feeling of complete focus and being in the zone for extended periods of time.</p>\n<h3>Challenge 2: letting fires burn</h3>\n<p>The main challenge at First Momentum has been the constant struggle to do the right thing.\nThere are always more things you should be fixing than you can actually fix.\nReid Hoffman's Masters of Scale podcast even has <a href=\"https://www.reidhoffman.org/why-the-best-entrepreneurs-let-fires-burn/\">an own episode</a> on it.\nIt can be compared with several fires burning around you at once.\nWhile you natural reaction would be to try to extinguish all fires,\nyour best reaction is to assess the fires and only deal with the ones, that will kill you within the next month,\nso you still have time to think about your actual strategy.\nIn reality, there are so many distractions and seemingly urgent things that shoot at you every day.\nUsually, your reaction would be to react and deal with everything (put out fires).\nWhat you actually should be doing is assessing their importance and to say NO more often (letting fires burn).\nIn conclusion, the challenge often was to act instead of react and thus have and keep a clear strategy.\nThis takes practice, a lot of effort, and you have to remind yourself over and over again.</p>\n<h3>Challenge 3: ageing, staying healthy</h3>\n<p>Most of people reading this will probably laugh.\nBut age has been an important aspect of my life this year.\nNot only was it the first year I have actually noticed to age,\nbut it was also an the first year not being a student anymore which also makes me feel older.\nOn top of that, I'm the second-oldest at First Momentum and get reminded from time to time.\nFurthermore, its quite a challenge to stay healthy when working more than 60 hours over extended periods of time.\nTo deal with age and health, I've started to do more sports, eat healthy, and sleep more.\nNot that I did not do it before, I now do it with more purpose and not only just for fun when I feel like it.</p>\n<h3>Challenge 4: staying social when stakes are high</h3>\n<p>Because of the workload this year, staying social has been quite a challenge.\nI mean, its easy to be social during university:\ndaily classes, lots of parties, enough time to socialize.\nBut since the workload has risen this year,\nI have to actually focus on keeping in touch with friends for the first time in my life.\nIt's just not as easy to have a beer or make a call after a long work-day.</p>\n<h2>My Learnings</h2>\n<p>2018 has not only been about challenges of course.\nWhen founding a startup, it's basically all about learning, fast!\nSo here are my top learnings this year:</p>\n<h3>Learning 1: say no. let fires burn.</h3>\n<p>As a founder, your first priority is to act strategically.\nTo do this, you need to have time, be relaxed, and focus.\nLike mentioned in my 2nd challenge this year, distractions are everywhere:\nevents with pitches or networking, people asking you for calls and meetings, startup competitions, you name it.\nWhile not all of these activities are a waste of time in general, they can become one quickly.\nThe one main question to ask yourself is: what is the best way to spend these eight hours?\nIs it really the conference?\nOr rather a one-on-one with a key employee and six calls with excellent founders you already know?\nSo this year was all about learning to say no.\nSaying no to pitches where our target audiences (founders or investors) are not present.\nSaying no to calls and meetings without a clear purpose or benefit.\nAnd saying no to startup competitions without huge monetary or marketing benefits.\nThis way, you will have a calendar with much more space to focus on the actually important things.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to learn more:\nThere's a great article on <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3009536/why-productive-people-have-empty-schedules\">Why productive people have empty schedules</a> including Warren Buffet.\nTim Ferris also has two great episodes on saying no (<a href=\"https://tim.blog/2017/11/25/how-to-say-no/\">#282</a> and <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2018/07/19/essentialism/\">#328</a>)</p>\n<h3>Learning 2: focus on what's really important</h3>\n<p>So after having cleared your schedule by saying no more often and by letting fires burn the question remains:\nWhat is the most important thing I should be working on?\nI don't know.\nAnd I'm often still not sure.\nI guess nobody launching a startup is and can be sure because of the intrinsic uncertainty.\nBut what I learned in 2018 is that you can learn to focus on what's really important.\nI basically started to take more time to re-think our status quo, week after week.\nIf you hear it, it may sound obvious, but things get ugly when you have a tight schedule, an unbearable workload, or deadlines to meet.\nBut still: nothing is more important than to reflect and to re-adjust your strategy.\nFor these strategy sessions, these are some of the questions I think about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what brings you one step closer to your vision?</li>\n<li>what is the task with the most leverage?</li>\n<li>which low-risk experiment could yield huge wins?</li>\n<li>which are the things that take most of your time? could they be more efficient? could they be replaced or even left out?</li>\n<li>what is the one hurdle that makes your life hard right now?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beside these questions, here are some topics I learned to focus on more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>continuous self-improvement: your priority is to grow</li>\n<li>thinking in long-term games: what can you do today to win in one year?</li>\n<li>startup culture: will keep your team together in tough times</li>\n<li>learning from others (podcasts, articles, mentors): others had your problems before and already solved them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Naval Ravikant has great tweetstorms on stuff like this, for example <a href=\"https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936\">How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)</a>.\nThere's also a great <a href=\"https://medium.com/@noahmadden/navalism-quotes-perceptions-by-naval-ravikant-a5fd60ac5788\">overview article on Medium</a>.\nIf you want to learn more about strategy and deriving tasks, I can highly recommend to look into OKRs and everything around them.\nAlso there's is a great episode on <a href=\"https://mastersofscale.com/#/mark-pincus-how-to-kill-your-bad-ideas-masters-of-scale-podcast/\">Masters of Scale: How to kill your bad ideas</a>.\nAnd my friend Feliks has written a great article on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@feliks/the-biggest-startup-strategy-myth-and-how-to-deal-with-it-455b034e93e8\">strategy vs. execution</a>.</p>\n<h3>Learning 3: growing your team is hard work</h3>\n<p>My company, First Momentum, grew from five founders to twelve employees this year.\nWhile this might not seem a lot, it is hard work.\nFirstly, you have to make sure your company culture stays on track.\nWhile the founders may have a common sense of what the company stands for, new employees don't und you thus have to make sure you communicate these values well and often.\nSecondly, the amount of work required to manage a team is underestimated.\nYou have to guide employees, explain things, and simply catch up with the emotionally from time to time.\nEspecially when new employees join the team, your deep work as a founder is reduced drastically.</p>\n<h3>Learning 4: others had your problems before</h3>\n<p>It's easy to bury one's head in the sand when working hard and to forget to look left and right.\nBut in fact, you should do the opposite:\nMany other founders had the same problems as you before.\nSo you can either try to come up with a solution yourself which takes a lot of time and effort.\nOr you can simply approach others and get feedback.\nThe natural tendency is to come up with an own solution,\nbut the smart solution is to stand on the shoulders of giants and learn from others.</p>\n<h2>My Achievements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Made our first closing along with national press coverage</li>\n<li>Made our first investments</li>\n<li>formed a team of
