It includes Gmail (without ads), Meet, Calendar, Drive with &amp;gt; 30 GB, Docs, etc.
What differentiates it from a regular Google account is that you can use your personal domain and thus your own email, e.g. mail@yourname.com.
After having used a G Suite of my company for a while, I wanted to have it for my personal email and domain, too.

It's simple, analogue, and convenient nonetheless.
I first noticed people using one in university, when we heard talks from founders at our university club.
At that time, I bought one myself to try it out and have never looked back.
And I think every founder should use one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I would like to articulate my love for notebooks.
And I would like to help you get started using one.
First, by talking about my usage.
Secondly, by summarizing the benefits.
And lastly, by giving some recommendations on which notebook to choose and how to structure it.
