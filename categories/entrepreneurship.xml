to reflect on things and to be able to see how I saw the world in a few years.
Also, if you haven't heard of me in 2018, this is the one article you should probably read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, I founded a venture capital fund, First Momentum, at the age of 27 in late 2017—at a point when I had not even finished university.
Gladly, I graduated last year while getting the fund running, so this year was all about getting traction.
Most notably this year, we managed to do our first closing and could since do our first investments.
Personally, I started to lead the investing team at First Momentum, currently consisting of five people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are my reflections on this year, my learnings, and my goals for 2019.

It's simple, analogue, and convenient nonetheless.
I first noticed people using one in university, when we heard talks from founders at our university club.
At that time, I bought one myself to try it out and have never looked back.
And I think every founder should use one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I would like to articulate my love for notebooks.
And I would like to help you get started using one.
First, by talking about my usage.
Secondly, by summarizing the benefits.
And lastly, by giving some recommendations on which notebook to choose and how to structure it.
